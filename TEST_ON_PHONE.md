## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"adb not found"**

```bash
# Install Android platform tools
brew install android-platform-tools

# Verify
adb --version
```

---

### **"No devices found"**

```bash
# Check connection
adb devices

# If empty, check:
# 1. USB cable connected
# 2. USB debugging enabled on phone
# 3. Phone unlocked
# 4. "Allow USB debugging" prompt accepted
```

---

### **"Installation failed"**

adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

---

### **App won't connect to backend**

The app should work immediately since it's using Cloud Run!

**Verify:**
```bash
# Test from your phone's network
curl https://budget-api-swpx3wltjq-uc.a.run.app/health
# Should return: ok
```

If you're on the same WiFi as your computer, it definitely works!
