## 🐛 Emulator Space Issue

**Current emulator is 100% full** - can't install updated APK.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use production build** - Build the release AAB and test on a real device
2. **Create new emulator** - Make one with 8GB+ storage
3. **Current emulator** - Google Sign-In works, but header buttons may be hidden

The UI fix is in your codebase, so any new build will include it!
