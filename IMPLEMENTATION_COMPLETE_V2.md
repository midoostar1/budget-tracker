## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```
1. User taps "Continue with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow completes
3. Frontend receives ID token
4. POST /api/auth/social-login with token
5. Backend validates token, creates/finds user
6. Backend returns accessToken (JWT) + refreshToken (httpOnly cookie)
7. Frontend stores accessToken in SecureStore
8. Frontend calls setupPushNotifications()
9. Frontend navigates to dashboard
```

### Token Management
- **Access Token**: Stored in SecureStore, sent in Authorization header
- **Refresh Token**: httpOnly cookie, automatically sent with refresh requests
- **Expiry**: Access token ~1 hour, refresh token ~30 days
- **Refresh**: Automatic on 401, triggered by Axios interceptor

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Test on Physical Device:

1. **Build the development client:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npx expo run:android --variant debug
   ```

2. **Verify backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl https://budget-api-813467044595.us-central1.run.app/health
   # Should return: ok
   ```

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Sign in with Google
   - Create a transaction (or scan receipt)
   - Verify device registration in backend logs
   - Upload 10 receipts to test quota
   - Confirm pending receipts

4. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   # Backend logs
   gcloud run services logs read mobile-backend --region=us-central1 --limit=50
   
   # Mobile app logs
   npx expo start --android
   # Check Metro bundler console
   ```

## 📦 Dependencies

All required dependencies are already in `package.json`:

- `axios` - HTTP client with interceptors
- `expo-secure-store` - Secure token storage
- `expo-notifications` - Push notifications
- `expo-image-picker` - Camera/gallery access
- `expo-camera` - Camera functionality
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching & caching
- `zustand` - State management

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Network Error" on API calls
**Solution:** Check that API URL is correct in `app.json` extra config

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" after login
**Solution:** Check that accessToken is being stored and sent in headers

### Issue: Receipt upload fails with no error
**Solution:** Check camera permissions and image URI format

### Issue: Paywall doesn't open on quota exceeded
**Solution:** Verify QuotaExceededError is being thrown and caught

### Issue: OCR data not showing
**Solution:** Check that backend OCR processing is working and signedUrl is valid
