## 🧪 Test Plan (After Deployment)

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Updated (in 5 min)

```bash
curl https://budget-api-813467044595.us-central1.run.app/health/detailed
```

### Step 2: Restart App on Emulator

```bash
# Force stop and restart
adb shell am force-stop com.budgettracker.app
adb shell am start -n com.budgettracker.app/.MainActivity
```

### Step 3: Test Google Sign-In

On emulator:
1. ✅ Tap "Sign in with Google"
2. ✅ Account picker appears
3. ✅ Select account
4. ✅ Consent screen (first time)
5. ✅ Sign in completes
6. ✅ Main screen appears

**Expected result:** Sign-in works! No 500 error!

### Step 4: Test Core Features

After successful sign-in:
- [ ] Create transaction
- [ ] View transaction list
- [ ] Edit transaction
- [ ] Delete transaction
- [ ] View reports
- [ ] Test camera (emulator has limited camera)
